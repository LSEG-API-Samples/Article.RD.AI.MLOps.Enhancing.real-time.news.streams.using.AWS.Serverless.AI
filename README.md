# Enhancing real-time news streams using AWS Serverless AI. An automated MLOps architecture using Terraform.


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Refinitiv Data (RD) libraries provide a powerful set of interfaces for uniform access to the Refinitiv data universe. The library provides multiple layers of abstraction providing for different styles and programming techniques suitable for all developers, from low latency real time access to batch ingestions.

In this article we present an AWS architecture that ingests our news feeds using RD libraries and enhances them using AI inference. In an effort to design a modular architecture, that could be used in most use cases, we decided to focus on the real-time space. The reason for this decision is that this is one of the most demanding use-cases and that the same architecture can also be used, with minimal tweaks, for batch AI inference. In our use case, we will implement a prototype that ingests our real-time news feed, calculates sentiment on each news headline using Artificial Intelligence and re-serves the AI enhanced feed through a publisher â€“ subscriber architecture. 

Moreover, to present a full MLOps stack we introduce the concept of Infrastructure as Code during the entire MLOps lifecycle of the prototype. By using Terraform and a single entry point configurable script, we can instantiate the entire infrastructure, in-production mode, on AWS in just a few minutes.
